    <h1>Intro Questions</h1>
    
        <p><b>Q1. Provide your name, major, year in school</b></p>
        <p>A1. My name is <em>Jungmin Kang</em>, majoring in <em>Communications Design</em> and <em>CS & Econ</em> joint major, and am a sophomore.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p><b>Q2. Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</b></p>
        <p>A2. I have a wide range of interests and one is marketing & advertising.</p>
        <p>I thought one of many important skills in those fields is making and designing a webpage that easily attracts others.</p>

        <br>

        <p><b>Q3. Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</b></p>
        <p>A3. I have little experience in <em>java</em> and <em>html</em>, but both are very intro-level.</p>

        <br>
        
        <p><b>Q4. Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</b></p>
        <p>A4. Making a viewer-interactive webpage.</p>

        <br>
        
        <p><b>Q5. Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</b></p>
        <p>A5. I could add images, links that guide the viewers to another page, or make other interactive elemenets perhpas like Apple website.</p>

        <br>
        
        <p><b>Q6. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</b></p>
        <p>A6. <a href="https://www.apple.com/"> apple </a></p>
        <p>Apple prevents the viewers from merely skimming through the site.</p>
        <p>It makes us stop at desired point and nearly make it impossible for us to miss out the important information</p>
        <p>Furthermore, by making the background black and simplifying the text using plain white color and unadroned font, the images strongly stand out.</p>

        <br>
        
        <p><b>Q7. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</b></p>
        <p>A7. <a href="https://www.storynory.com/archives/fairy-tales/">storynory</a></p>
        <p>This website adds a speicial element, audio.</p>
        <p>This additional aspect of the website increases the interaction between the viewer and the website.</p></p.>

        <br>
        
        <p><b>Q8. Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</b></p>
        <p>A8. <a href="https://wovenmagazine.com/"> wovenmagazine</a></p>
        <p>The overall design seems very simple, allowing the viewers to glance at the entire page.</p>
        <p>However, the transitions or interactions between the web user, perhaps when you hover over an item a new list comes out, adds an interesting taste to the webpage, making it unique.</p>
