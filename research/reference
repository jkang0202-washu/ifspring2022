        </div>

        <div class="instructions">
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350F (180C) degrees.</li>
                <li>Line a 9x13 inch pan with parchment paper and leave an overhang around the sides.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Chocolate Chip Cookie Layer</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Beat together the melted butter, brown sugar and white sugar.</li>
                <li>Beat in the eggs and vanilla extract.</li>
                <li>With the mixer on low speed, beat in the flour and salt</li>
                <li>Turn off the mixer and stir in the chocolate chips using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon.</li>
                <li>Spoon the mixture into the prepared pan, and spread smooth with a spatula.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Oreo Layer</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place the Oreo cookies on top of the cookie dough pressing them down slightly</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Brownie Batter</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Add the butter and chocolate to a large heatproof bowl. Microwave on medium power for 45 second intervals, stirring between each, until melted.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar.</li>
                <li>Whisk the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture.</li>
                <li>Gently fold in the flour, cocoa powder and salt using rubber spatula or wooden spoon.</li>
                <li>Pour the brownie batter over the Oreo cookie layer, and spread the top smooth as needed.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Baking and Cooling</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Bake the brownies in the preheated oven for 50-55 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out dry or with a few damp crumbs. If you notice the top is starting to burn, cover with aluminum foil and continue baking. I first check my brownies at 45 minutes just in case.</li>
                <li>Cool the brownies fully (at least 4 hours) before slicing for clean, even cuts.</li>
                <li>Store leftovers at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 4 days.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <p>Semi-sweet chocolate can be substituted for dark chocolate. However, chocolate that's more than 60% cocoa is not recommended.</p>
            <p>Recipe can be halved and made in a 9x9 inch pan, the bake time will be about the same or slightly shorter. </p>

            <h2>Recipe Websites</h2>
            <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/"> Food Network </a>
            <p>The Food Network uses good visual hierarchy and the page is organized in an effective way for scanning.I think it was useful to make the numbers much larger because steps are very clear. The ingredient list can also act as a checklist for users. </p>
            <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/"> allrecipes </a>
            <p>Allrecipes has a really simplified layout that makes it easy to read and navigate. It is a scrolling page and they have some useful buttons for quick access to printouts or sharing. Users can also adjust the serving size and have it reflected in the ingredient list. </p>
            <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/?action=click&module=nav&region=logo&pgType=front-page"> NYT Cooking </a>
            <p>NYT Cooking recipes have a very clean layout and the website is easy to navigate. The ingredients list also includes a link to substitutions which could be helpful for people with allergies. I also think the way the text styles are different in different columns helps with legibility. </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Non-Recipe Websites</h2>
            <a href="https://www.hellomonday.com/"> Hello Monday </a>
            <p>Initially, the scrolling animation on this website was really captivating and unique. Although the navigation is different than a lot of other websites, it is still intuitive. The hover states on the images are also an interesting way of showing interaction.</p>
            <a href="https://sefaspices.com/"> Sefa Spices </a>
            <p>Sefa Spices is a food delivery service so the organic shapes and clean layout match the content well. I also thought the colors were really inviting without making the website too busy. The information hierarchy is very well developed on this website and easy to read. </p>
            <a href="https://www.behance.net/galleries?tracking_source=nav20"> Behance </a>
            <p>Behance has a good approach to displaying a lot of information on one page. They have a simple layout to balance the colorful and busy content, which helps the clarity of the website. </p>
